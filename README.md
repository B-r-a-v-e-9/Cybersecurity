<h1>Research and study about Malwarebytes</h1>

This is just the beginning of my cybersecurity career!

<h2>TASK 1: Learn and explore the workings of Malwarebytes</h2>

*I'm quite curious about how Malwarebytes operates. How does this application detect malware, malicious code, and harmful programs?*

<h3>Signature-based scanning</h3>

> As far as I know, **signature-based scanning** is a technique that uses known malicious code *snippets* or *hashes* of malware found on the Internet. Malwarebytes then compares those malicious codes with the source code of the suspected application.

> I realize that the Signature-based scanning technique has a weakness! It is that when the suspected malicious source code does not match due to it not having been previously detected or known, it becomes a serious issue.
>> To address the above issue, they have applied another technique, which is **Heuristic Analysis**.
<h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>

> Heuristic Analytics is a method of detecting and preventing malware that Malwarebytes utilizes. Instead of relying on rigid definitions of viruses or malware, Heuristic Analytics employs intelligent algorithms to identify suspicious behaviors and activities. This allows for the detection of new and previously undefined threats.

> Here are the key drawbacks of heuristic analysis
>>Lower accuracy
>>Easily evaded
>>High resource requirements
>>Requires continuous updates
>>Difficult to explain
 
<h3>Behavior Monitoring</h3>

<h3>Web Protection</h3>
